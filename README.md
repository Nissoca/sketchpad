# sketchpad
Training Project-  A web page for sketching with the mouse

This is a training exercice focus on javascript and jquery learning. In this project I developed a web page with a grid of elements that change color when the user moves the mouse over them. The user can specify the resolution of the sketchpad by clicking in the button clear. 

Try it out and have fun!

ps: values over 1300 can take a while to load.
